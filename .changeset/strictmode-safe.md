Fix: the editor now survives React StrictMode. Previously, StrictMode's dev-only mount → unmount → remount tore down the controller's document subscriptions (`observeDeep` + undo) and left a dead controller behind, so the editor stopped reacting to edits.

`EditorController` now exposes idempotent `connect()` / `disconnect()`, and `useEditor` disconnects on unmount and reconnects on mount instead of destroying — so the same controller (and all its state) is reused across StrictMode's double-mount. `destroy()` remains for terminal teardown. No API changes for existing callers.

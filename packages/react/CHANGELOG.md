# @wingleeio/ori-react

## 0.0.3

### Patch Changes

- f5ea26d: Fix: the editor now survives React StrictMode. Previously, StrictMode's dev-only mount → unmount → remount tore down the controller's document subscriptions (`observeDeep` + undo) and left a dead controller behind, so the editor stopped reacting to edits.

  `EditorController` now exposes idempotent `connect()` / `disconnect()`, and `useEditor` disconnects on unmount and reconnects on mount instead of destroying — so the same controller (and all its state) is reused across StrictMode's double-mount. `destroy()` remains for terminal teardown. No API changes for existing callers.

## 0.0.2

### Patch Changes

- e182518: Clicking empty space in the editor — surrounding padding or the gutter below the last block — now focuses the editor and drops the caret at the nearest position, instead of doing nothing. The pointer handler is bound to the whole scroller rather than just the text canvas (with a guard so native scrollbar drags still work).

# @wingleeio/ori-react

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 1ba87f2: Rebuild the editor on **contentEditable** for native text editing.

  The view layer now hands caret, selection, the iOS spacebar-trackpad, native selection menus (Copy / Look Up / Translate), the loupe, dictation and IME to the browser, while every edit is routed through the `EditorController` (Y.Doc). One editable surface means selection spans across blocks. The view stays **virtualized** — only the on-screen window of blocks is rendered, between offscreen spacers sized from Pretext measurement — and a branded caret overlay is drawn on top (the native caret is hidden via `caret-color`).

  - `EditorController`: adds `blockIds()`, `getInline()`, `getBlockType()`; `InlineItem` is now exported.
  - `@wingleeio/ori-react`: `<NoteEditor>` keeps the same props/handle. The old custom-render + hidden-textarea path (and its `BlockView` / `SelectionLayer` / `CaretLayer` / `handleKeyDown` / `pasteText` exports) is removed.

## 0.0.4

### Patch Changes

- 8962d71: Native-feeling text interaction on touch devices (iOS/Android) and unified pointer input.

  - **Gestures**: tap places the caret, double-tap selects the word, triple-tap selects the block, and long-press selects the word — all via a single Pointer Events pipeline (mouse / touch / pen).
  - **Selection handles**: iOS-style draggable handles appear on touch and adjust the selection ends.
  - **Scroll vs. select**: a vertical touch-drag scrolls; selection drags don't fight it (`touch-action`).
  - **Native caret + typing**: on touch, the hidden input mirrors the focused block's text and selection, so the iOS spacebar-trackpad and native caret traverse real characters; typing/autocorrect reconcile into the editor by diff. Desktop keeps its existing keymap-driven model unchanged.
  - **Core**: adds `EditorController.selectWordAt`, `selectBlockAt`, `orderedSelection`, and the pure `wordBoundsAt` helper.

## 0.0.3

### Patch Changes

- f5ea26d: Fix: the editor now survives React StrictMode. Previously, StrictMode's dev-only mount → unmount → remount tore down the controller's document subscriptions (`observeDeep` + undo) and left a dead controller behind, so the editor stopped reacting to edits.

  `EditorController` now exposes idempotent `connect()` / `disconnect()`, and `useEditor` disconnects on unmount and reconnects on mount instead of destroying — so the same controller (and all its state) is reused across StrictMode's double-mount. `destroy()` remains for terminal teardown. No API changes for existing callers.

## 0.0.2

### Patch Changes

- e182518: Clicking empty space in the editor — surrounding padding or the gutter below the last block — now focuses the editor and drops the caret at the nearest position, instead of doing nothing. The pointer handler is bound to the whole scroller rather than just the text canvas (with a guard so native scrollbar drags still work).

# @wingleeio/ori-core

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 1ba87f2: Rebuild the editor on **contentEditable** for native text editing.

  The view layer now hands caret, selection, the iOS spacebar-trackpad, native selection menus (Copy / Look Up / Translate), the loupe, dictation and IME to the browser, while every edit is routed through the `EditorController` (Y.Doc). One editable surface means selection spans across blocks. The view stays **virtualized** — only the on-screen window of blocks is rendered, between offscreen spacers sized from Pretext measurement — and a branded caret overlay is drawn on top (the native caret is hidden via `caret-color`).

  - `EditorController`: adds `blockIds()`, `getInline()`, `getBlockType()`; `InlineItem` is now exported.
  - `@wingleeio/ori-react`: `<NoteEditor>` keeps the same props/handle. The old custom-render + hidden-textarea path (and its `BlockView` / `SelectionLayer` / `CaretLayer` / `handleKeyDown` / `pasteText` exports) is removed.

## 0.0.3

### Patch Changes

- 8962d71: Native-feeling text interaction on touch devices (iOS/Android) and unified pointer input.

  - **Gestures**: tap places the caret, double-tap selects the word, triple-tap selects the block, and long-press selects the word — all via a single Pointer Events pipeline (mouse / touch / pen).
  - **Selection handles**: iOS-style draggable handles appear on touch and adjust the selection ends.
  - **Scroll vs. select**: a vertical touch-drag scrolls; selection drags don't fight it (`touch-action`).
  - **Native caret + typing**: on touch, the hidden input mirrors the focused block's text and selection, so the iOS spacebar-trackpad and native caret traverse real characters; typing/autocorrect reconcile into the editor by diff. Desktop keeps its existing keymap-driven model unchanged.
  - **Core**: adds `EditorController.selectWordAt`, `selectBlockAt`, `orderedSelection`, and the pure `wordBoundsAt` helper.

## 0.0.2

### Patch Changes

- f5ea26d: Fix: the editor now survives React StrictMode. Previously, StrictMode's dev-only mount → unmount → remount tore down the controller's document subscriptions (`observeDeep` + undo) and left a dead controller behind, so the editor stopped reacting to edits.

  `EditorController` now exposes idempotent `connect()` / `disconnect()`, and `useEditor` disconnects on unmount and reconnects on mount instead of destroying — so the same controller (and all its state) is reused across StrictMode's double-mount. `destroy()` remains for terminal teardown. No API changes for existing callers.
